# Narrative Precisionism
Narrative Precisionism is a writing style that employs economical use of words to create vivid, impactful narratives, engaging the reader's imagination to fill in the details. It prioritizes clarity, evocativeness, and directness, leaving much to the reader's interpretation.

## The Goal of Narrative Precisionism
The goal is to create a memorable, immersive experience without extensive exposition, allowing the narrative to resonate more personally with the reader. It's like painting a vast landscape with just a few strokes, where each word carries weight and the unsaid builds the atmosphere.

## How It Works
1. Focus on Key Details: Identify the most essential elements of your scene or narrative. These are the pivot points around which emotions, actions, and consequences revolve.
2. Implied Depth: Allow room for the reader's imagination to fill in the gaps. The power of suggestion is more potent than explicit description in this style.
3. Economy of Language: Use the fewest words possible. Every word should serve a purpose, whether it's advancing the plot, deepening a character, or enriching the setting.
4. Strong Imagery: Choose vivid, concrete imagery over abstract description. Let these images do double duty by implying more than they say outright.
5. Subtext is Key: What’s left unsaid is just as important as the words on the page. The spaces between the words are filled with tension, questions, and meanings.
6. Active Voice: Favor active voice over passive voice for its directness and energy.

## Techniques for Reduction
- Trim Adjectives and Adverbs: Focus on strong nouns and verbs instead. If you must use descriptors, make sure they're impactful.
- Merge Actions: Combine actions where possible to streamline the narrative. "He picked up the glass and drank" becomes "He sipped from the picked-up glass."
- Imply, Don’t Explain: Allow actions and contexts to suggest feelings and thoughts instead of stating them. "She was sad" becomes "Tears blurred her vision."
- Leave Out Common Knowledge: If something can be assumed or is widely understood, don’t mention it. Focus on what adds unique value to your narrative.

### Example 1
Before: "In the early morning light, she quietly walked down the deserted, damp streets of the city, feeling a mix of apprehension and excitement about the secret meeting she was about to attend."
After: "Dawn silhouetted her quick steps to the secret meeting, a thrilling shadow in the empty streets."

### Example 2
Before: "He looked at the old photograph of his family with a sense of nostalgia, remembering the days when they were all together and happy."
After: "The old photograph whispered of lost laughter."

### Example 3
Before: "The abandoned house at the end of the street, covered in overgrown vines and with broken windows, seemed to hold within it the echoes of the many lives that had once inhabited it."
After: "Vines and shattered glass dressed the abandoned house, silent keeper of echoes."

## How to Think About It
Approach each sentence with the intent of evoking a scene, emotion, or thought in as few words as necessary. Imagine each word costing a precious resource; spend wisely to convey the essence of your narrative. It's about striking the right balance between brevity and expressiveness, leaving enough on the page to engage the reader's imagination to build the world beyond the words written.

## Conclusion
Narrative Precisionism isn’t just about making things shorter; it’s about making each word work harder. This often involves reevaluating what information is truly necessary and finding more potent ways to express it, leading to prose that is both dense with meaning and elegantly sparse.
